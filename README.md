üòä Smile And Unlock üîì

A smart door access system that uses facial emotion recognition to allow access only when the person is smiling. Built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this project integrates computer vision and deep learning to bring emotion-aware security systems to life.

üìç Overview

Smile And Unlock is a CNN-based facial expression recognition project designed to detect smiles in real-time video input. The door (or simulated unlock mechanism) triggers only when the user's facial expression shows a genuine smile. The project demonstrates how emotion detection can be used for practical smart home or office security solutions.

Features

- Real-time facial detection using OpenCV
- CNN model for emotion classification
- Triggers an unlock action only if a smiling face is detected
- Simple UI interface for demo/testing
- Model trained on FER-2013 dataset (or other annotated emotion datasets)

Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- FER-2013/GENKI- 4K Dataset
- Google Colab (for model training and experimentation)

Smile and Unlock ‚Äì Dataset Exploration

This project is part of a deep learning research initiative to detect smiles from facial images. The current milestone explores the GENKI-4K dataset for training a binary classification model.

Objectives
- Finalize and load GENKI-4K dataset
- Inspect image shapes and label balance
- Visualize sample images and class distribution
- Prepare data preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalize, split)

Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - GENKI-4K](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhasar/genki4k)
- Format: Grayscale facial images, 64√ó64 resolution
- Labels: 0 (No Smile), 1 (Smile)

Next Milestone
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for smile detection
- Train and evaluate model performance
