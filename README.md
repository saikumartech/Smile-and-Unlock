üòä Smile And Unlock üîì

A smart door access system that uses facial emotion recognition to allow access only when the person is smiling. Built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this project integrates computer vision and deep learning to bring emotion-aware security systems to life.

üìç Overview

Smile And Unlock is a CNN-based facial expression recognition project designed to detect smiles in real-time video input. The door (or simulated unlock mechanism) triggers only when the user's facial expression shows a genuine smile. The project demonstrates how emotion detection can be used for practical smart home or office security solutions.

Features

- Real-time facial detection using OpenCV
- CNN model for emotion classification
- Triggers an unlock action only if a smiling face is detected
- Simple UI interface for demo/testing
- Model trained on FER-2013 dataset (or other annotated emotion datasets)

Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- FER-2013/GENKI- 4K Dataset
- Jupyter Notebook (for model training and experimentation)
